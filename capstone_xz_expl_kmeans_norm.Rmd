## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

## read data file

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df_norm_bin <- read.csv(file ='c:/work/source/cell5m_15_na_rm_norm_binnedTarget.csv')
str(df_norm_bin)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# use dependent variable 4 levels: n=4,  kmeans
```{r}
data_kmeans<- kmeans(df_norm_bin[, 6:16], 4) 
data_kmeans
```

check clustering result against dependent variable levels to see how they compare.  
```{r}
table(data$vp_n_bin, data_kmeans$cluster)
```
